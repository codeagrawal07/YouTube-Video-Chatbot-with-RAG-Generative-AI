# YouTube Video Chatbot with RAG & Generative AI

A conversational AI chatbot that allows users to interact with YouTube video content through natural language queries. This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Google Gemini's Large Language Model (LLM) to provide accurate, contextual answers based on extracted video transcripts.
